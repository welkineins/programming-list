# Programming List
A programming related tools and libraries list

## C/C++

### Base Library
- [POCO](http://pocoproject.org/) - Modern, powerful open source C++ class libraries for building network- and internet-based applications that run on desktop, server, mobile and embedded systems.
- [Atria](http://abletonag.github.io/atria/) - Atria is a toolkit for modern C++ development. It provides core components that extend the standard library's capabilities. It provides (mostly) header-only libraries of general interest, in the spirit of the STL, Boost, Adobe Source Libraries or Facebook's Folly and Fatal.

### GUI Framework
- [CopperSpice](http://www.copperspice.com/) - CopperSpice is a C++ library derived from the existing Qt 4.8 framework. Our goal was to change the core design of the libraries, leveraging template functionality and C++11 capabilities.

### Web Framework
- [Wt](http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt) - Wt (pronounced as witty) is a C++ library for developing web applications. The API is widget-centric and uses well-tested patterns of desktop GUI development tailored to the web. 

### Actor Framework
- [CAF_C++ Actor Framework](http://actor-framework.org/) - An Open Source Implementation  of the Actor Model in C++.

### Concurrent Library
- [CDS](http://libcds.sourceforge.net/) - CDS is a C++ template library of lock-free and fine-grained algorithms. It contains a collection of concurrent data structure implementations.

### Generator
- [cpp_range](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpp_range) - Python-like range iterators for C++

### Math
- [Libmvec](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/libmvec) - Libmvec is vector math library added in Glibc 2.22.

### Embedded Application
- [macchina](http://macchina.io/) - macchina.io is an open source software toolkit for quickly building embedded applications for the Internet of Things that run on Linux-based devices like the Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, RED Brick or Galileo/Edison.

### Build
- [Biicode](https://www.biicode.com/) - C and C++ Dependency Manager with CMake on steroids

### Linter
- [flint](https://github.com/facebook/flint) - An open-source lint program for C++ developed by, and used at Facebook.

### Protocol
- [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) - The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable cross-language services development, combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other languages.
- [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) - FlatBuffers is an efficient cross platform serialization library for C++, with support for Java, C# and Go. It was created at Google specifically for game development and other performance-critical applications.
- [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) - MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.
- [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) - Apache Avro™ is a data serialization system.

### Network
- [libtins](http://libtins.github.io/) - libtins is a high-level, multiplatform C++ network packet sniffing and crafting library.

### Signal/Slot
- [nano-signal-slot](https://github.com/NoAvailableAlias/nano-signal-slot) - Pure C++11 Signals and Slots

### Test
- [CDSChecker](http://plrg.eecs.uci.edu/software_page/42-2/) - CDSChecker is a model checker for C11/C++11 which exhaustively explores the behaviors of code under the C/C++ memory model. It uses partial order reduction as well as a few other novel techniques to eliminate time spent on redundant execution behaviors and to significantly shrink the state space.
- [CPP Testing Example](https://github.com/spencewenski/cpp_testing_example)- This is an example of how to set up Google testing frameworks for a project.

## Java

### Caching
- [Ehcache](http://ehcache.org/) - Ehcache is an open source, standards-based cache for boosting performance, offloading your database, and simplifying scalability. It's the most widely-used Java-based cache because it's robust, proven, and full-featured. Ehcache scales from in-process, with one or more nodes, all the way to mixed in-process/out-of-process configurations with terabyte-sized caches.

### Protocol
- [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) - The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable cross-language services development, combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other languages.
- [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) - FlatBuffers is an efficient cross platform serialization library for C++, with support for Java, C# and Go. It was created at Google specifically for game development and other performance-critical applications.
- [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) - MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.

## JavaScript

### UI Framework
- [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) - Vue.js is a library for building modern web interfaces. It provides data-reactive components with a simple and flexible API.

### Mobile UI Framework
- [Ironic](http://ionicframework.com/) - The beautiful, open source front-end SDK for developing amazing mobile apps with web technologies.

### Web Framework
- (Play)[https://www.playframework.com/] - ay is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture. Built on Akka, Play provides predictable and minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) for highly-scalable applications.

### Visualization
- [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) - p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing.
- [TURF](http://turfjs.org/) - Advanced geospatial analysis for browsers and node

### Testing
- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) - PhantomJS is a headless WebKit scriptable with a JavaScript API. It has fast and native support for various web standards: DOM handling, CSS selector, JSON, Canvas, and SVG.
- [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) - Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) also be automated as well.

### Embedded Application
