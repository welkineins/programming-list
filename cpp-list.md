### Generator
- [cpp_range](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpp_range) - Python-like range iterators for C++

### Format
- [cppformat](https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat) - C++ Format is an open-source formatting library for C++. It can be used as a safe alternative to printf or as a fast alternative to IOStreams.

### Media
- [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/) - Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.

### Math
- [Libmvec](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/libmvec) - Libmvec is vector math library added in Glibc 2.22.

### Protocol
- [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) - The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable cross-language services development, combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other languages.
- [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) - FlatBuffers is an efficient cross platform serialization library for C++, with support for Java, C# and Go. It was created at Google specifically for game development and other performance-critical applications.
- [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) - MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.
- [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) - Apache Avroâ„¢ is a data serialization system.
- [Aeron](https://github.com/real-logic/Aeron) - Efficient reliable unicast and multicast message transport.

### Test
- [CDSChecker](http://plrg.eecs.uci.edu/software_page/42-2/) - CDSChecker is a model checker for C11/C++11 which exhaustively explores the behaviors of code under the C/C++ memory model. It uses partial order reduction as well as a few other novel techniques to eliminate time spent on redundant execution behaviors and to significantly shrink the state space.
- [CPP Testing Example](https://github.com/spencewenski/cpp_testing_example)- This is an example of how to set up Google testing frameworks for a project.
