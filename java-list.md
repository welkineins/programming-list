## Java

### Caching
- [Ehcache](http://ehcache.org/) - Ehcache is an open source, standards-based cache for boosting performance, offloading your database, and simplifying scalability. It's the most widely-used Java-based cache because it's robust, proven, and full-featured. Ehcache scales from in-process, with one or more nodes, all the way to mixed in-process/out-of-process configurations with terabyte-sized caches.

### Protocol
- [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) - The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable cross-language services development, combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other languages.
- [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) - FlatBuffers is an efficient cross platform serialization library for C++, with support for Java, C# and Go. It was created at Google specifically for game development and other performance-critical applications.
- [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) - MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.
- [tchannel](https://github.com/uber/tchannel) - Network multiplexing and framing protocol for RPC.

### Database
- [StorIO](https://github.com/pushtorefresh/storio) - modern API for SQLiteDatabase and ContentResolver.

### JNI
- [jna](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) - JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries without writing anything but Java code - no JNI or native code is required. This functionality is comparable to Windows' Platform/Invoke and Python's ctypes.
